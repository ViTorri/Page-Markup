            <p>Aliens Corp is a product development consultancy that works with startups and established businesses while also creating open source-based products & services. We uncovers anonymous buying behavior, prioritizes accounts for sales and marketing, and enables them to engage resistant
            buying teams with personalized, multi-channel, multi-touch campaigns. 6sense helps revenue teams know everything they
            need to know about their buyers so they can easily do anything needed to generate more opportunities, increase deal
            size, get into opportunities sooner, and compete and win more often.</p>
            <p>Our work encompasses graphics and identity, strategy and positioning, products and packaging, exhibitions and
            installations, websites and digital experiences, advertising and communications, data visualizations and typefaces,
            sound and motion. Our 22 partners are all practicing designers, and whether working collaboratively or independently,
            they do so in friendship.</p>
            <p>Our structure is unique. We are the only major software studio where the owners of the business are the creators of the
            work and serve as the primary contact for every client. This reflects our conviction that great design cannot happen
            without passion, intelligence and—above all—personal commitment, and is demonstrated by a portfolio that spans five
            decades, many industries, and clients of every size.</p>
